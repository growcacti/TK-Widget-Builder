# TK-Widget-Builder
This application is a Widget Designer tool that allows users to dynamically create, preview, and generate code for various tkinter widgets with customizable properties.

Overview of the Code:
Initialization and Setup:

The WidgetDesignerApp class initializes the main application window.
The colorlist is passed to the app to populate dropdown menus for background and foreground color selections.
Layout:

The app uses multiple ttk.LabelFrame containers to organize its sections:
Widget Properties: A form for users to select widget type and customize properties (e.g., text, size, colors).
Widget Preview: Displays the preview of the configured widget.
Generated Code: Displays the code for the configured widget.
Actions: Provides buttons to clear the preview, copy code to the clipboard, and save the code to a file.
Widget Property Customization:

Allows users to configure properties such as:
Type (e.g., Entry, Button, ComboBox, ListBox, Text, Canvas, ScrolledText)
Text, Width, Height, Relief, Background Color, Foreground Color, and Border Width.
Dynamic Widget Generation:

The generate_code method dynamically creates widgets based on the user's input and adds them to the preview area.
It also generates the corresponding tkinter code and displays it in the code text area.
Utility Functions:

Clear All: Removes all widgets from the preview and clears the generated code.
Copy to Clipboard: Copies the generated code to the system clipboard.
Save to File: Saves the generated code to a Python file.
Color Customization:

Uses an extensive predefined list of colors (colorlist) for users to select background and foreground colors.
Main Execution:

When executed, the root window is created, and an instance of the WidgetDesignerApp class is initialized, starting the main application loop.
